# LexSovereign: Full Feature List

LexSovereign is a high-fidelity **Sovereign Legal Operating System** designed for private regional enclaves. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for law firms and enterprise legal departments to manage matters, drafting, and compliance within jurisdictional boundaries.

## 1. Platform & Global Governance
*   **Global Control Plane**: Single-pane-of-glass for managing the entire multi-tenant infrastructure.
*   **Regional Silo Partitioning**: Hard-pinning of data and compute to jurisdictional boundaries (using Terraform-driven regional silos).
*   **Hybrid Pricing Engine**: Dynamic calibration for Global Admins to manage tiered base fees, per-user billing, and AI credit quotas.
*   **Tenant Onboarding Inception**: A specialized flow for initializing new law firms or enterprise legal departments into their own private partitions.
*   **Branding & Customization**: Support for white-labeling, including custom logos, typography, and jurisdictional document formatting.

## 2. Legal Operations & Practice Management
*   **Legal Drafting Studio**: Structural document generation using AI-assisted templates with "Safe Clause" verification.
*   **Sovereign Matter Vault**: Secure, jurisdictional-aware repository for managing legal matters and discovery documents.
*   **Conflict of Interest Ledger**: Cryptographically protected conflict check workflows before matter initiation.
*   **Workflow Design Engine**: A visual tool for creating complex legal approval cycles (e.g., Associate Drafting → Partner Review → Client Sign-off).
*   **Sovereign Marketplace**: A repository for sharing and acquiring verified, jurisdiction-neutral legal templates.
*   **Practitioner Directory**: Centralized management of personnel, roles, and cryptographic identities.

## 3. Advanced AI & Compliance Guardrails
*   **Regulatory Rules Engine (RRE)**: Real-time monitoring of AI and human outputs against jurisdictional statutes (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, Banking Secrecy Act).
*   **PII Sanitization Proxy (DAS)**: Semantic **Data Access Service** that scrubs sensitive identifiers before they reach the LLM, ensuring privacy-safe inference.
*   **Dual-Agent Adversarial Auditing**: An independent "Auditor" agent that intercepts primary AI outputs to prevent **Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL)**.
*   **Forensic Decision Ledger**: An immutable trace-ledger providing cryptographic proof of the reasoning behind legal decisions or AI-generated advice.

## 4. Security, Identity & Cryptography
*   **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)**: Hardware-anchored (HSM) encryption allowing firms to hold their own master keys.
*   **Silo-Direct Identity**: Authentication logic specifically bound to the regional partition's security module.
*   **Hardware-Enforced MFA**: Mandatory multi-factor authentication anchored to hardware enclaves.
*   **Sovereign Password Reset**: Secure, internal recovery flow for managing practitioner access without external dependence.

## 5. Collaboration & Reporting
*   **Secure Client Portal**: A restricted environment for clients to track matter progress and view non-privileged documents safely.
*   **Billing & Growth Analytics**: Dashboards for tracking firm utilization, AI credit consumption, and financial performance.
*   **Omnichannel Preview**: Multi-format document rendering (PDF, DOCX, Markdown) within the drafting environment.
