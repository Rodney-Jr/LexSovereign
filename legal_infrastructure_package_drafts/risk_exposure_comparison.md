# Risk Exposure Comparison (Before vs. After)

> **CONFIDENTIAL MEMO - FOR INTERNAL LEGAL REVIEW ONLY**
> **DO NOT PUBLISH EXTERNALLY**
> **Goal:** Visualize the measurable mitigation of institutional risk vectors.

| Risk Vector | Previous State Exposure Level | Hardened Legal Infrastructure Exposure Level (Post-Deployment) | Mitigation Mechanism Employed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Attorney-Client Setup Claim** | **High** (Ambiguous platform language could imply service provision). | **Low** | Prominent Disclaimers; Strict Non-formation clause included in all onboarding frameworks. |
| **AI Output Hallucination** | **Critical** (AI errors producing invalid legal arguments resulting in user malpractice suits). | **Low** | Explicit GenAI Supervisory Obligations; User Acknowledgment of non-reliance. |
| **Financial / Malpractice Liability** | **Critical** (Unbounded risk of enterprise clients suing for direct or indirect losses caused by software failure). | **Low** | Ironclad Limitation of Liability; Financial Cap applied (e.g., 12 months subscription fee); Exclusion of indirect/punitive damages. |
| **Conflict Checking Reliance** | **Medium** (Users relying entirely on algorithmic search and failing professional obligations). | **Low** | Conflict Check Non-Reliance Disclaimer inserted, explicitly forcing manual verification. |
| **GDPR / CCPA Subcontractor Fines** | **High** (Lack of defined role; lack of DPA execution). | **Low** | Structured DPA; Clear "Processor" vs "Controller" definitions; SCC transfer mechanisms defined. |
| **Security Misrepresentation** | **Medium** (Marketing language making unverifiable claims of "100% security"). | **Very Low** | Internal Claim Validation Checklist; Softened marketing parameters; Transparent disclosure table. |
