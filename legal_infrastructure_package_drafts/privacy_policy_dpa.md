## Part I: Privacy Policy (Summary Framework)
*For website visitors and registered users acting in their capacity as account administrators.*

### 1. Data Controller vs. Processor Positioning
- **Controller Context:** NomosDesk acts as a Data Controller for account administration, billing data, platform telemetry, and website analytics.
- **Processor Context:** For all Client Data, Legal Matters, and Case Information uploaded into the SaaS platform, the customer (the law firm or legal department) acts as the Data Controller. NomosDesk acts strictly as a **Data Processor** operating under the instructions of the customer.

### 2. Lawful Basis for Processing (Controller Context)
We process personal data based on the following justifications:
- **Contractual Necessity:** To provide the platform and authenticate logins.
- **Legitimate Interest:** To improve our software, ensure security, and prevent fraud.
- **Consent:** For marketing communications (where required by law).
- **Legal Obligation:** To comply with tax and accounting rules.

### 3. AI Training Transparency Language
**No Training on Confidential Client Data:** We do NOT use Customer Data (including case files, matters, documents, or personal data uploaded by the customer into the platform) to train, refine, or improve our base foundational AI models or third-party AI models without explicit, written opt-in consent.

## Part II: Data Processing Addendum (DPA Framework)
*To be signed or agreed to via the Terms of Service for SaaS customers processing Personal Data subject to the GDPR, CCPA, or UK GDPR.*

### 4. Data Retention Schedule
We retain Customer Data only as long as the account is active or as dictated by the customer's instructions in the application settings.
Upon termination or expiration of the Agreement, NomosDesk will, at the customer’s request, securely delete or return all Customer Data, unless retention is strictly required by applicable law (e.g., financial transaction records).

### 5. Cross-Border Transfer Safeguards
If we process Personal Data originating from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, or Switzerland in a jurisdiction not deemed adequate, such transfers will be subject to robust safeguards.

**[Placeholder: Insert Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) Reference]** 
*Legal Note: Adopt the EU Commission’s 2021 standard contractual clauses with Module 2 (Controller-to-Processor) or Module 3 (Processor-to-Processor) as applicable.*

### 6. Subprocessor Disclosure & Registry
The customer authorizes NomosDesk to engage third-party subprocessors to deliver the platform infrastructure. A current list of subprocessors is available at **[Insert Link to Subprocessor Listing Page]**.

We execute Data Processing Agreements with all subprocessors, imposing equivalent data protection obligations upon them. We will notify customers of intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of subprocessors, giving customers the opportunity to object.

### 7. Breach Notification Protocol
In the event of a confirmed Personal Data Breach affecting Customer Data, NomosDesk as the Processor shall notify the Customer (the Controller) without undue delay, and in any event within **[Insert timeframe, e.g., 48 or 72 hours]** after becoming aware of the breach. NomosDesk will provide reasonable assistance to the Customer in fulfilling their obligation to report the breach to supervisory authorities and affected data subjects.
