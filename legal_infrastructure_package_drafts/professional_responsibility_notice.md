"NomosDesk is a tool designed to enhance the efficiency of legal professionals. However, the use of our Services does not relieve you of your professional obligations under the applicable rules of professional conduct in your jurisdiction (e.g., the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, or equivalents).

**Draft Language:**
"**No Substitute for Manual Conflict Checking:** While NomosDesk provides algorithmic search capabilities intended to assist in identifying potential related parties or adverse interests across your tenant database, this tool is strictly an administrative aid. Operational constraints, data input errors, or search limitations may result in incomplete outputs. **You must not rely exclusively on the NomosDesk platform to clear conflicts of interest.** You remain professionally obligated to establish, maintain, and execute comprehensive conflict-of-interest policies and manual verification processes prior to accepting new representation."
