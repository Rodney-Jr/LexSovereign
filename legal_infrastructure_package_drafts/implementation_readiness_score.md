# Implementation Readiness Score

> **CONFIDENTIAL MEMO - FOR INTERNAL LEGAL REVIEW ONLY**
> **DO NOT PUBLISH EXTERNALLY**

## Current Status: 75% Ready for Review

The structural documents and defensive frameworks are complete. The remaining 25% consists of founder strategic input and outside counsel validation.

| Evaluation Metric | Score (1-10) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Defensive Architecture** | 9/10 | Excellent coverage of AI generative risks and professional responsibility disclaimers. |
| **Liability Allocation** | 9/10 | Strong caps and indemnification structures built into the Terms of Service. |
| **Privacy / Regulatory Baseline** | 8/10 | Solid framework established (DPA, SCC placeholders). Requires accurate subprocessor cataloging. |
| **Corporate Transparency** | 6/10 | Framework exists, but requires the insertion of actual corporate registration numbers and technical audit proofs. |
| **Marketing Alignment** | 7/10 | The audit flags the risks; actual implementation requires retraining the marketing team to adopt the softened, legally defensible language. |

## Next Steps for Deployment

1.  **Founder Review:** The founders must complete the `outstanding_information_required.md` document, selecting the governing jurisdictions, liability caps, and confirming actual security capabilities.
2.  **Licensed Counsel Review:** This entire `legal_infrastructure_package_drafts` directory must be sent to licensed legal counsel. Counsel will formalize the language, verify jurisdictional compliance, and finalize the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs).
3.  **UI/UX Integration:** Once approved by counsel, the engineering team will build the structural UI components (e.g., the "Accept Terms" checkbox during signup, the click-through AI acknowledgment in the Drafting Studio, and the persistent footer links) to integrate these documents into the application flow. No deployment should happen until counsel signs off.
