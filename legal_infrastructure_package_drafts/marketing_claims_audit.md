# Marketing Claims Risk Audit

> **CONFIDENTIAL MEMO - FOR INTERNAL LEGAL REVIEW ONLY**
> **DO NOT PUBLISH EXTERNALLY**
> **Goal:** Identify potential liability risks hidden within marketing language. Exaggerated claims can act as unauthorized warranties, exposing the company to breach of contract or deceptive trade practice claims.

## 1. Extract & Assess Marketing Claims

*This is an initial checklist assessing common themes against specific risks.*

### Area 1: Product Capabilities (The AI Draft Studio)
* **High-Risk Claim:** "The AI drafts perfect contracts every time."
* **Substantiation Level:** Low/Impossible. AI output is probabilistic by nature.
* **Risk Type:** Breach of warranty, misrepresentation.
* **Soften Recommendation:** Instead of "perfect," use "accelerates the drafting process" or "provides robust foundational drafts for review."

### Area 2: Compliance Outcomes
* **High-Risk Claim:** "Using NomosDesk makes your law firm instantly GDPR compliant."
* **Substantiation Level:** False. Software cannot provide end-to-end compliance; compliance depends on the user's operational practices, organizational policies, and legal framework application.
* **Risk Type:** Deceptive trade practice, assumption of regulatory liability.
* **Soften Recommendation:** "NomosDesk provides powerful tools built with privacy-by-design principles to support your firm's GDPR compliance initiatives."

### Area 3: Cost and Financial Promises
* **High-Risk Claim:** "NomosDesk will cut your firm's operational costs by 50% guaranteed."
* **Substantiation Level:** Anecdotal/Context-dependent. Requires significant case studies to prove.
* **Risk Type:** Breach of contract, false advertising.
* **Soften Recommendation:** "Designed to streamline workflows, helping firms reduce administrative overhead and improve margin potential." (Or use specific, verified case study data: "Firm X saw a 30% reduction in document drafting time.")

### Area 4: Practice Area Applicability
* **High-Risk Claim:** "The software contains all necessary legal templates for any jurisdiction."
* **Substantiation Level:** Low/Impossible. Jurisdictions update constantly and are highly nuanced.
* **Risk Type:** Negligent misrepresentation, unauthorized practice of law liability.
* **Soften Recommendation:** "Includes a diverse library of foundational templates standard to common law jurisdictions, designed to be localized and configured by licensed counsel."

## 2. Compliance Claim Verification Checklist

Use the following framework internally before publishing new marketing materials to the website or external channels:

- [ ] **The "Guaranteed Outcome" Test:** Does the copy promise an outcome the software cannot independently guarantee?
- [ ] **The "Absolute Knowledge" Test:** Does the copy use words like "all," "never," "perfect," "100%," or "instant" without qualitative caveats?
- [ ] **The "AI Capability" Test:** Is the role of the AI appropriately framed as an *assistive tool* rather than an *authoritative replacement* for human judgment?
- [ ] **The Security Definition Test:** If claiming a specific certification (SOC 2, ISO, HIPAA), do we hold the finalized, signed auditor's report?
- [ ] **The Jurisdictional Disclaimer Test:** Does the copy imply that the software provides jurisdictionally precise legal forms without the necessary legal disclaimer attached?
