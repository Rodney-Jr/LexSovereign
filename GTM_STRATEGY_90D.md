# NomosDesk: 90-Day Zero-Budget GTM Execution Strategy

## 1. Executive Strategy Summary
NomosDesk's path to the first 10 paying clients is not through "visibility" but through **authority and compliance dominance**. In zero-budget environments, the **Founder is the Primary Distribution Channel**. We will leverage the platform's unique "Sovereign Infrastructure" as a wedge to displace generic, un-enclaved legal tools.

## 2. Early Adopter "Wedge" Strategy
| Segment | High-Probability Persona | Strategic Wedge |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Corporate Legal** | Head of Compliance / GC (Fintech/Regtech) | "Data Sovereignty & Automatic PII Scrubbing" |
| **Boutique Law Firms** | Managing Partner (Corporate/IP) | "Drafting Velocity & Secure Client Exits" |
| **SME Services** | Independent Company Secretary | "Compliance Orchestration for Board Portals" |

## 3. Sharp Positioning Statement
> **"NomosDesk is Africa’s first Sovereign Legal OS. We provide the only workflow and document intelligence platform that hard-pins your legal data to local jurisdictional enclaves—giving you Big Law security and AI drafting velocity without the un-safe cloud exposure."**

## 4. 90-Day Execution Roadmap (Weeks 1–12)

### Phase 1: Authority & Network Seeding (Weeks 1–4)
- **Week 1-2**: **The Authority Audit.** Optimize LinkedIn (Founder-led). Content focus: "Why Legal Data in US Clouds is a Liability for African Firms."
- **Week 3**: **The Outreach Sandbox.** Curate a list of 100 high-intent prospects (GCs and Managing Partners) using LinkedIn Sales Navigator (Free Trial).
- **Week 4**: **The "Modern Legal Ops" Webinar.** Host a free, live session on "Sovereign AI in Legal Practice" via LinkedIn Live/Zoom.

### Phase 2: The Founding Client Cohort (Weeks 5–8)
- **Week 5**: **High-Signal Outreach.** Send 20 personalized Loom videos per week. *Script*: Show their website → Show a "Compliance Gap" → Show NomosDesk's solution.
- **Week 6-7**: **Pilot Demo Sprints.** Aim for 10 demos/week. Focus on the **Founding Client Offer**.
- **Week 8**: **The $1 Enrollment.** Secure verbal commitment for the first 5 "Founding Clients."

### Phase 3: Conversion & Expansion (Weeks 9–12)
- **Week 9-10**: **Implementation & Success.** Onboard and ensure early "Quick Wins" (e.g., first matter Vault established, first AI-drafted contract).
- **Week 11**: **Referral Engine.** Offer a "1-for-1" referral month for the next 5 slots.
- **Week 12**: **The Close.** Transition all 10 Founding Clients to paid Annual Subscriptions.

## 5. Zero-Cost Acquisition Channels (Ranked by ROI)
1.  **Founder-Led LinkedIn Authority Content (ROI: 10/10)**: Daily "Tactical Pills" on Legal Ops + Jurisdictional Compliance.
2.  **Personalized Video Outreach (Loom) (ROI: 9/10)**: High conversion rate for busy GCs compared to cold email.
3.  **Community Stealth (ROI: 8/10)**: Meaningful participation (non-spam) in Ghana Bar Association (GBA) and Africa Legal Tech WhatsApp groups.
4.  **Strategic Referral Partners (ROI: 7/10)**: Cross-referral with IT Audit firms or Company Secretarial consultants.

## 6. Founder-Led Sales Playbook
### The "Sovereign Advantage" Sales Script
1.  **Pain Point**: "Did you know that 90% of legal AI exposure today inadvertently sends your PII to servers in unauthorized jurisdictions?"
2.  **The Wedge**: "NomosDesk uses a Data Access Service (DAS) to scrub PII *before* it leaves your enclave."
3.  **The Offer**: "We’re opening 10 Founding Client slots this quarter. You get lifetime pricing and priority feature influence in exchange for a case study."

## 7. Founding Client Offer Blueprint (Pricing Psychology)
- **Anchor Price**: $499/month (Standard Enterprise).
- **Founding Client Offer**: **$99/month (Life-Lock)** or **$950/year upfront**.
- **Psychological Trigger**: "Limited to the first 10 firms to ensure high-touch implementation success."

## 8. Conversion Architecture (Funnel)
1.  **Awareness**: LinkedIn Daily Tactical Post.
2.  **Interest**: "Sovereign Legal Ops" Free Guide (Lead Magnet).
3.  **Desire**: Personalized Demo (PII Scrubbing Proof).
4.  **Action**: Founding Client Agreement Sign-off.

## 9. 10-Client Acquisition Pathway (Step-by-Step)
1.  Target 5 Fintech GCs (Ghana/Nigeria) concerned with data residency.
2.  Target 3 Corporate Law Firms (Tier 2/3) needing drafting automation.
3.  Target 2 Company Secretary firms handling board management.

## 10. Metrics Dashboard & Leading Indicators
- **Leading Indicator**: 20 Loom videos sent/week.
- **Conversion Metric**: 25% demo-to-pilot rate.
- **Lagging Indicator**: Total Revenue (ACV) and Time-to-Onboard.

## 11. Risk Analysis & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Long sales cycles in legal.
- **Mitigation**: Focus on the **Wedge Feature** (e.g., just the PII-safe Drafting or the Vault) instead of the full platform suite to close faster.
