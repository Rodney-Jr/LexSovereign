Welcome to NomosDesk. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the NomosDesk software platform (the "Services"). By using our Services, you agree to these Terms.

**1. Platform Positioning & Not Legal Advice**
NomosDesk provides workflow software and AI-assisted tools for legal professionals. **We are not a law firm.** We do not provide legal advice. Your use of the Services does not create an attorney-client relationship. You remain solely responsible for your professional obligations, ethical compliance, and the quality of the legal representation you provide.

**2. License & Account Access**
Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access and use the Services for your internal business purposes. You are responsible for safeguarding your account credentials and for all activities occurring under your account.

**3. Acceptable Use**
You agree not to:
* Use the Services for illegal purposes or to facilitate the unauthorized practice of law.
* Upload malicious code, viruses, or attempts to breach our security.
* Reverse engineer or attempt to copy the platform's underlying technology.

**4. AI Tool Acknowledgment & Disclaimers**
The platform features automated AI assistance ("AI Tools").
* **Assistive Only:** AI Tools are designed to assist, not replace, professional human judgment. You must independently review, verify, and validate all AI-generated content before relying upon it.
* **No Warranty on Output:** NomosDesk does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or jurisdictional validity of AI outputs (which may contain "hallucinations" or errors).

**5. Conflict Checking Limitation**
Our internal search and indexing features may aid in identifying potential conflicts; however, they are purely administrative aids. You agree not to rely exclusively on NomosDesk to clear legal conflicts of interest. You maintain full responsibility for executing manual conflict checks required by your jurisdiction.

**6. User Data & Confidentiality**
You retain ownership of the data you upload ("Customer Data"). You grant NomosDesk a limited license to process this data solely to provide the Services. We will protect Customer Data using industry-standard security measures.

**7. Warranties and Disclaimers**
THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR PERFECTLY SECURE.

**8. Limitation of Liability**
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NOMOSDESK SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, OR MALPRACTICE CLAIMS). 
OUR TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO NOMOSDESK IN THE **[TWELVE (12)]** MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.

**9. Indemnification**
You agree to defend and indemnify NomosDesk from any claims or damages arising from (a) your breach of these Terms, (b) your violation of applicable laws or ethical rules, or (c) claims from third parties regarding your substantive legal representation.

**10. Service Modification & Termination**
We reserve the right to modify or interrupt the Services for maintenance. We are not liable for any resulting downtime (Force Majeure events excepted). You may cancel your subscription at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access for violating these Terms.
