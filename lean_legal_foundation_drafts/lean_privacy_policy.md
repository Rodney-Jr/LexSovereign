> **DRAFT ONLY - PENDING HUMAN REVIEW**

**Effective Date:** [INSERT DATE]

This Privacy Policy explains how NomosDesk ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our software platform and website. 

**1. Data Roles: Controller vs. Processor**
* **As a Controller:** We control the data necessary to manage your account (e.g., your name, billing email, payment information, and usage analytics).
* **As a Processor:** For the legal case files, client data, and matter details you upload into the platform ("Customer Data"), you (the law firm) act as the Data Controller. We act strictly as a Data Processor operating under your instructions.

**2. Information We Collect**
* **Account Information:** Name, email, firm details, and payment processing information (handled via secure third parties like Stripe).
* **Platform Usage Data:** IP addresses, browser types, and interaction metrics to help us improve the system.
* **Customer Data:** The specific legal documents and client information you choose to host on our platform.

**3. How We Use Information**
We use your information to:
* Provide, maintain, and secure the NomosDesk platform.
* Process your subscription payments.
* Communicate with you regarding updates, support, and platform notices.
* Detect and prevent fraud or security incidents.

**4. Artificial Intelligence & Data Usage**
* We use third-party AI providers via secure APIs to power the "Drafting Studio" and generative features. 
* **No Training on Customer Data:** The specific case files, prompts, and client data you submit to our AI tools are processed for immediate output generation only. We DO NOT use your Customer Data to train our foundational models, and our API agreements legally prohibit our third-party AI providers from using your data to train their models.

**5. Data Sharing & Subprocessors**
We do not sell your data. We share data only with trusted third-party service providers (subprocessors) necessary to run our infrastructure (e.g., cloud hosting, email delivery, payment routing). These providers are bound by strict confidentiality and data protection agreements.

**6. Security Practices**
We implement industry-standard security practices, including data encryption in transit and at rest, secure access protocols, and regular system monitoring, to protect your data from unauthorized access. (Note: While we strive to protect your data, no internet transmission is 100% secure).

**7. Data Retention**
We retain your account information as long as your account is active. When you cancel, we will delete or anonymize your Customer Data according to our internal deletion schedules, unless legal obligations require further retention.

**8. Your Rights**
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data. Please contact us to exercise these rights regarding your account information.
