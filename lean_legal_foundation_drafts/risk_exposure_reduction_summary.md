| Risk Vector | Exposure Posture (Without Action) | Exposure Posture (With Lean Foundation Deployed) | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unlimited Platform Liability** | **Critical** (Open-ended financial damages from platform bugs or downtime). | **Managed/Low** | Implementation of strict financial caps (12-month subscription limit) and exclusion of indirect damages. |
| **AI Malpractice (Hallucination)** | **High** (Lawyers suing platform over bad AI drafting). | **Managed/Low** | Strong "Assistive Only" AI tool disclaimers requiring mandatory independent attorney review. |
| **Unintended Attorney-Client Ties** | **High** (Ambiguous marketing implying service provision). | **Low** | Clear, repeated "Technology Platform Not a Law Firm" disclaimers on all key touchpoints. |
| **False Advertising / Warranty Breaches** | **Medium** (Unverified ISO/GDPR or "military-grade" claims). | **Low** | Audit implemented to soften claims to defensible "industry-standard" language. |
| **Manual Conflict Check Failure** | **Medium** (Users relying entirely on software to clear conflicts). | **Managed** | Explicit language mandating the user retains final responsibility for conflict checks. |
