# Executive Summary of Risk Reduction (Lean Version)

> **CONFIDENTIAL MEMO - FOR INTERNAL REVIEW ONLY**

The "80-20 Lean Legal Foundation" provides NomosDesk with a defensible, minimum-viable compliance posture. This package is explicitly designed to reduce immediate regulatory and civil exposure, build trust with early adopters, and support the acquisition of the first paying customer without the cost and complexity of an enterprise-level legal overbuild.

## Key Outcomes

1.  **Liability Capped:** The Terms of Service establish clear financial caps (e.g., explicitly limiting liability to the preceding 12 months of subscription fees), protecting the startup from unbounded damages in the event of an early-stage failure or data incident.
2.  **AI Disclaimers Established:** The core agreements prominently disclaim liability for AI hallucinations, shifting the responsibility for validating any AI-generated legal document entirely onto the licensed user, thereby mitigating Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL) risks.
3.  **Positioning Clarified:** Across all touchpoints (homepage, footer, and intake forms), NomosDesk is rigorously classified as a "technology platform" and not a law firm. This blocks the implication of an attorney-client relationship.
4.  **Claim Defensibility:** The privacy and marketing audits have stripped away unverifiable compliance jargon (e.g., un-audited "ISO Certification" claims or "100% secure" language) in favor of defensible, "industry-standard" terminology.

## Next Steps
This lean framework prioritizes speed to market over exhaustive corner-case coverage. Once the founders populate the required placeholder fields (see `founder_decision_points.md`), this package should undergo a final sanity check by legal counsel focused on the specific jurisdiction of operation, after which it will be ready for launch.
