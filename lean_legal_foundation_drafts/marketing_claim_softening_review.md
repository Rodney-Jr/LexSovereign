# Marketing Claim Softening Review (Lean Version)

> **DRAFT ONLY - PENDING HUMAN REVIEW**
> *Goal: Identify and soften unverifiable compliance claims to reduce early-stage liability.*

| Internal Claim / High-Risk Topic | Example Hard Claim (Do Not Use) | Softened Lean Alternative | Reason for Change |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Encryption** | "Military-grade 256-bit encryption protects all your data." | "Your data is secured using industry-standard encryption protocols." | "Military-grade" is an arbitrary, highly auditable standard. "Industry-standard" is legally defensible for startups. |
| **System Security** | "Our platform is 100% secure against hackers and breaches." | "We utilize robust security practices to safeguard your practice data." | Promising 100% security immediately creates a breach of warranty claim if an incident occurs. |
| **Compliance Readiness** | "Instantly guarantees your firm is fully GDPR & CCPA compliant." | "Provides a secure infrastructure framework to support your firm's privacy compliance goals." | Software merely *supports* compliance; the user's operational practices dictate actual legal compliance. |
| **Certifications** | "SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 Certified Infrastructure." | "Deployed on secure, top-tier cloud infrastructure providers (e.g., AWS)." | Do not claim certifications the company itself has not formally completed an audit for, even if underlying hosting providers have them. |
| **AI Reliability** | "The AI generates perfect, court-ready legal documents." | "The Drafting Studio accelerates early-stage document creation for final attorney review." | AI output holds a statistical probability of hallucination. Do not guarantee legal perfection. |
